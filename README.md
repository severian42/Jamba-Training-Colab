# Colab notebook for Training Jamaba SSM-Transformers model

## Notes

- Will need to run A100 to pull this off
- Jamba seems to be finicky and different to fine-tune than standard transformer models (at least in my case so far). Start light on your settings and definitely check your first checkpoint for overfitting
